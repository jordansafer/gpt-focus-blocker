## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Default block-list | Ships with major social, news, and video sites pre-blocked. |
| ChatGPT negotiation | When you attempt to visit a blocked site, you must convince ChatGPT (via your own API key) to grant access. |
| Timed overrides | ChatGPT can grant 10 s, 5 min, 2 h, or unlimited access. A badge shows time remaining; the page re-blocks automatically. |
| Advanced auto-review | Unknown domains are sent to ChatGPT for quick **BLOCK / ALLOW** classification. |
| Proof with images | Upload a (down-sampled) screenshot/photo to prove you completed a task; ChatGPT reviews it (vision model required). |
| Model selector | gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, or gpt-o3. |
| Fully local data | API key and settings stay in `chrome.storage.local`; no trackers, no analytics. |
